Set up Python
================

Please follow the instructions below to set up an appropriate environment to use PyHyperScattering.  All of these setup steps should be run in a terminal, not a Jupyter notebook.

These instructions have been tested for the use of PyHyperScattering in a local JupyterLab notebook using the Anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/download) on a Windows computer.  The instructions below *might* work for other platforms (e.g., NSLS II Jupyterhub, Google Colab), but there are no guarantees; recently, the NSLS II Jupyterhub has been especially incompatible PyHyperScattering.
